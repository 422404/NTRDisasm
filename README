This is a work-in-progress project which aims at reverse
engineering and documenting the NTR 2.0 custom firmware (CFW)
for the Nintendo N3DS. The CFW contains some interesting
features and tricks to learn from, such as

- the injection of code into foreign processes by
  temporarily modifying Kernel objects
- displaying in-game menus by writing to LCD registers
- "stealing" service handles from known locations of
  other processes
- hooking code
- implementation of a debugger
- client / server code
- a plugin system
- calling privileged ARM11 code using svcBackdoor()
- running games from other regions by patching their SMDH

There are two idc files, ntr.idc is for public 2.0 and the other for 2.3.
Please take a look before you load the binaries at 0x100100.
This project would not include ntr.bin file, go find it yourself.
